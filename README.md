### Total Number Of Retiring Employees

Over the next three years Pewlett Hackard will see around 72,458 workers retire from the company. This number is an estimation based on the current number of employees on staff who were born between 1952 – 1955. 

### Retirements Per Departments 

Not only will the sheer number of employees retiring be something to address but since many of these employees on staff have been with the company for several years this boom in retirement will make waves from the top down like a reverse pytamid. This is because the majority of people retiring will be from the “Senior” level of the company.

Over the next three years we will lose over a quarter of our Senior level staff: 26.7%.

### Remaining Employees Per Departments

## Mentorship Plan

To lessen the negative effects of the upcoming wave of retirements Pewlett Hackard developed a plan for the outgoing employees to mentor potential replacements for them so that upon retirement the company transition would be as smooth as possible. 

### Number of mentor ready employees

The criteria for mentorship were employees currently at the company born in the year 1965.

### Mentor ready employees Per Department

## Summary

### Mentorship Plan

From a practical standpoint the number of people eligible for the mentorship plan is too small. Using only senior level positions as an example there is no way to replace the outgoing **50,842** employees from the Senior Engineer and Senior Staff positions with only **738** employees. Furthermore were this plan to be acted out the company would be faced with _another wave of retirements_ when all the employees born in 1965 hit retirement age. The number of retirements would pale in comparison but the significance of them may not; were all these key leadership roles filled by people born in the same year. 

### Recommendation

The number of employees for the mentorship program must be significantly increased to meet the vacancies left by outgoing staff. Even if some of the positions were eliminated or combined the current number of those eligible for mentorship is simply not enough to fill the upcoming gap within the company. 

It is also recommended that the criteria for mentorship be expanded simply beyond birth year. To continue in this manner would only guarantee a repeat of the current situation the company is in right now once those born in 1965 for example reached retirement age (as noted above).
